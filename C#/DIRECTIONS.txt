Change C# version to 1.26 because later verisons will break the intellisense.
Use 'dotnet --list-sdks' to get all the sdks installed.
Use 'dotnet new globaljson' to list the sdk you want in the project.
Use 'dotnet --verison' to check to see if the version is correct.
Use 'dotnet run' to run the code.
